### Traits

**_Flyby._** Elara doesn’t provoke [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) when she flies out of an enemy’s reach.

**_Obedient Vassal._** In combat, Elara acts during your turn. She can move and use her Reaction on her own, but the only action she takes is the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action unless you take a Bonus Action to command her to take an action. If you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, Elara acts on her own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.

**_Durable Ward._** Damage that would reduce Elara's hit points to zero only confers the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition. You can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to touch her and expend a spell slot. The condition is removed after 1 minute with all her Hit Points restored.

### Actions

**_Aerial Assault._** _Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:_ +6, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) Piercing damage.
